## Overview
Since 2012, Gallup publishes [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2019/) every year in which it ranks countries by how happy people around the world perceive themselves to be. By using the findings from this report, a correlation analysis on the level of happiness among participating countries was conducted to identify the following:

* Correlation studies among 11 factors that may have contributed to the happiness ranks
* Trends in the happiness ranking by the geographical location
* The top two most contributing factors to happiness
